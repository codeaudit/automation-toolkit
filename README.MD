# Installation

## System Requirements
- The application uses `docker-compose` to run all services (local web dashboard, APIs, and a local Parity Ethereum node). Docker-compose can be installed on any MacOS, Windows, or Linux machine. Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install to install docker-compose on your platform.
- Download the application from 'Releases' (TODO: Have a page and a link for this) and unpack the .zip in a location of your choice
- Run `sudo docker-compose up` from the root directory. This is creating the environment from source, so it will probably take several minutes.
